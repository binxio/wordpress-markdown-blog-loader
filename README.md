# wordpress-markdown-blog-loader
This utility loads markdown blogs into Wordpress as a post. It allows you to work on your blog
in your favorite editor and keeps all your blogs in git.

## features
- converts markdown into plain html, with syntax hightlighting support
- uploads and synchronizes any locally referenced images
- generates an opengraph image including the title, subtitle and author in Binx.io or xebia.com style
- sets the Yoast focus keywords
- sets the canonical url, if specified

## caveats
- changing the slug may orphan images
- removing images from the markdown, will leave dangling images in Wordpress
- you cannot edit via WP and via the uploader, without confusing yourself

## required Wordpress Plugins

- [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)
- [REST API Meta Support](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-meta-support/)

Furthermore, you have to enable the Rest API for the [Custom Field Group](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/wp-rest-api-integration/#enabling-the-rest-api-for-your-acf-fields) for the field `show_header_image`.

## Installation
Install it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) or use Docker (see below):
```shell
pipx install wordpress-markdown-blog-loader
```

## configuration
to configure the access credentials, you need to add your WordPress application password to the file `~/.wordpress.ini`  
and add a section for your Wordpress installation:

```
[DEFAULT]
host = xebia.com

[xebia.com]
username = <your wordpress username>
```

## api host
If the site is served through a CDN, you can also set the `api_host` which will be used as the hostname to invoke the WP REST API. 

## password
To authenticate you need an [application password](https://wordpress.com/support/security/two-step-authentication/application-specific-passwords/), which is different from the user password.

We recommend to store  your application password in 1password and set the environment variable
  WP_APP_PASSWORD using the [1password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli):

```shell
WP_APP_PASSWORD="$(op read "op://Private/wordpress app password/password")" wp-md ...
```

## Never touch the WP editor again

Once you start to manage your blogs via this uploader, *do not edit* the blog via one of the WP editors. The editors are weird,
because it appears to make a copy of the content on which you get a WYSIWIG viewer. Unfortunately, it does not detect changes
in the actual blog content. It will look like your uploaded changes are not applied (but they are).

## Using the docker image
To use the docker image as a command line utility, create the following alias:

```bash
alias wp-md='docker run \
 -e WP_APP_PASSWORD="$(op read "op://Private/wordpress app password/password")" \
 -v $HOME:$HOME \
 -v $HOME/.wordpress.ini:/root/.wordpress.ini \
 -v $PWD:/$PWD \
 -w $PWD ghcr.io/binxio/wordpress-markdown-blog-loader:1.3.1
```'
Assuming that your WordPress app password is stored in the 1password Private vault under the name `wordpress app password`

## start a new blog
To start a new blog, type:

```bash
$ wp-md posts new \
	--title "How to create a WordPress blog without touching WordPress" \
        --subtitle "using the wp-md utility" \
	--author "Mark van Holsteijn" \
	--image ~/Downloads/background-image.jpg \
        --image-credits "image by xyz"
